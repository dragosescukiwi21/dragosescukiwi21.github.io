                        <p class="card-text"><strong><em>Electric cars</em></strong> are poised to replace internal combustion cars in the coming years as the world shifts towards a cleaner and more sustainable future. Electric cars are already proving to be more efficient, cheaper to run and maintain, and environmentally friendly than their petrol counterparts. They emit zero tailpipe emissions and require no oil changes, making them a more eco-friendly option.<br><strong><em>In addition</em></strong>, advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have made electric cars more practical and convenient for daily use. With fast-charging stations becoming more common, electric vehicles can now be charged in a matter of minutes, making long-distance travel possible. Moreover, electric cars have already started to become more affordable as production scales up and batteries become cheaper.<br>As governments around the world continue to push for a reduction in carbon emissions, it is clear that electric cars will play a significant role in achieving this goal. With more automakers committing to producing electric vehicles, and countries offering incentives to encourage the adoption of electric cars, it is only a matter of time before they become the dominant form of personal transportation.</p>
